# 404 — Page Not Found

The page you were looking for could not be found. It seems you've taken a wrong turn, the link is broken, or the content you're seeking has wandered off.

It's a frustrating feeling to be lost, but take heart.

While this page is lost in the digital wilderness, **you can never be lost to God**. In those moments when we feel disoriented or far from our path, there is a promise of a Shepherd who seeks us out relentlessly.

> “No ditch too deep, no wall too high. He leaves the ninety-nine to find the one.”

This is a reminder of an active, searching love. Jesus Himself told this parable to show that very truth:

_"What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?"_ (Luke 15:4, KJV)

So while this page can't be found, you are known, sought, and valued.

### What to do now?
