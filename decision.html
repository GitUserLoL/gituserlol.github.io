            <p><strong>You’ve heard the gospel — you know what Christ has done.</strong>
                But maybe you’re hesitating. Maybe you’re not sure you’re ready, or you feel like you need to “get your
                life
                together first.”</p>
            <p>The truth is, no one is ever <em>ready</em> in that sense. Salvation isn’t about you fixing yourself —
                it’s
                about admitting that you can’t, and trusting the One who can.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Every heartbeat is a gift of mercy. None of us are promised another day. To delay is to choose
                uncertainty when
                God offers assurance.</p>

            <h2>Why This Decision Can’t Wait</h2>
            <p>If a house is on fire, you don’t wait to walk out when it’s more convenient — you run.
                The gospel isn’t something to consider when life gets quiet or comfortable. It’s a message for
                <strong>now</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Life is uncertain.</strong> None of us know how long we have.</li>
                <li><strong>Sin is deadly.</strong> It separates us from the God who made us.</li>
                <li><strong>Christ’s offer is open.</strong> But it won’t last forever.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>God’s grace is calling. The door is open — but it must be entered.</p>

            <p class="muted">We all wrestle with doubts and questions. Tap to expand.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>1) How do I know if I’m truly ready to be saved?</summary>
                <p>
                    You are “ready” when you come to Christ as a sinner who needs Him, not when you’ve fixed yourself.
                    In
                    Scripture, those who were “pricked in their heart” (Acts 2:37) were told to repent and believe the
                    gospel
                    (Acts 2:38; Mark 1:15). Readiness is the work of God’s Spirit producing <em>godly sorrow</em> (2 Cor
                    7:10), a
                    turning from sin to God, and faith in Christ’s finished work (Rom 3:24–26; 10:9–13). If you see your
                    sin,
                    believe that Jesus died and rose for you, and are willing to forsake self-rule to trust and follow
                    Him (Luke
                    9:23; Isa 55:6–7; John 3:14–18), then come now—He says, “him that cometh to me I will in no wise
                    cast out”
                    (John 6:37, KJV).

            <details>
                <summary>2) What if I’ve done too much wrong for God to forgive me?</summary>
                <p>
                    Christ saves “sinners; of whom I am chief,” said Paul (1 Tim 1:15–16). The blood of Jesus is
                    sufficient for
                    the <em>worst</em> of sinners: “though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow” (Isa
                    1:18). At
                    the cross, a condemned thief was pardoned that very day (Luke 23:39–43). God removes sin “as far as
                    the east
                    is from the west” (Ps 103:12) and casts it “into the depths of the sea” (Mic 7:18–19). Where sin
                    abounded,
                    grace did much more abound (Rom 5:20). The issue is not the greatness of your sin, but the greatness
                    of
                    Christ’s sacrifice—come to Him.

                <summary>3) Do I have to change before coming to Jesus?</summary>
                <p>
                    No. You come as you are; He changes whom He receives. Jesus came not to call the righteous, but
                    sinners to
                    repentance (Luke 5:31–32). We are justified by faith, not by self-reform (Rom 4:5; Titus 3:5). When
                    you come,
                    God gives a new heart and Spirit (Ezek 36:26–27), and then a new life flows out: “if any man be in
                    Christ, he
                    is a new creature” (2 Cor 5:17). The order is crucial: come to Christ → declared righteous in Him →
                    begin to
                    be made holy by Him.

                <summary>4) How do I know this is real and not just emotion?</summary>
                <p>
                    Build on God’s promises, not your feelings. Jesus promises to receive all who come (John 6:37); the
                    gospel
                    promises salvation to all who believe and confess Christ (Rom 10:9–11). God wants believers to
                    <em>know</em>
                    they have eternal life (1 John 5:11–13). The Spirit bears witness with our spirit (Rom 8:15–16), and
                    over time
                    fruits confirm reality: growing obedience (1 John 2:3), love for believers (1 John 3:14),
                    perseverance in
                    truth (1 John 2:19), and repentance when you sin (1 John 1:9). Assurance rests first on the
                    <em>objective</em>
                    work and word of God (Eph 2:8–9), then is strengthened by the Spirit’s ongoing work in you.

                <summary>5) What if I fail again after becoming a Christian?</summary>
                <p>
                    Christians still battle sin, but they do so with a Savior, an Advocate, and a new power. When you
                    sin,
                    confess—“he is faithful and just to forgive” (1 John 1:9). Christ is your Advocate with the Father,
                    and His
                    propitiation stands (1 John 2:1–2). God completes the work He begins (Phil 1:6); the righteous falls
                    and rises
                    again (Prov 24:16). Expect your Father’s loving discipline that yields holiness (Heb 12:5–11), and
                    keep
                    walking by the Spirit who enables real change (Gal 5:16–24). Your failures are not final because
                    Christ’s
                    righteousness and intercession are (Heb 7:25).

            <details>
                <summary>6) What if I don’t feel anything when I pray?</summary>
                <p>
                    Seasons of dryness are common (Ps 42). We live by faith, not by sight (2 Cor 5:7). God invites you
                    to pour out
                    your heart (Ps 62:8) and to draw near with confidence because of Christ (Heb 10:19–22). Faith is fed
                    by the
                    Word (Rom 10:17), so stay under Scripture, prayer, fellowship, and the Lord’s Table (Acts 2:42; Heb
                    10:24–25).
                    Examine yourself for unconfessed sin (Ps 66:18) and keep asking, seeking, knocking (Matt 7:7–11).
                    Whether you
                    feel it or not, Christ ever lives to intercede for you (Heb 7:25), and God meets those who wait for
                    Him (Isa
                    64:4).

            <h2>Counting the Cost</h2>
            <p>Jesus never hid the cost of following Him. He didn’t invite people to an easy life — He called them to
                die to
                self and live for Him.</p>
            <blockquote>
                “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.” —
                Luke 9:23
            </blockquote>
            <p>Following Christ means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Turning away from sin — not perfectly, but sincerely.</li>
                <li>Placing Him above everything — even comfort and approval.</li>
                <li>Trusting that He is worth infinitely more than what you leave behind.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Christian life is not about adding religion; it’s about <strong>surrender</strong> — a new heart, a
                new
                master, a new purpose.
                It costs you your pride, but gives you peace. It costs you your sin, but gives you salvation.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>You don’t need fancy words — only a sincere heart. God already knows what you need.
                If you’re still undecided, take time to read the Gospel again, pray honestly, and ask God to show you
                the truth.
            </p>
            <p>But remember — neutrality is not an option. To remain undecided is to say “not yet” to the One who died
                for
