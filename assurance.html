            <h2 style="margin-top:0">The Assurance of Eternal Life</h2>
            <h3>Are you 100% sure that you have eternal life?</h3>
            <p>If you are struggling with this question, it is essential to look at the Scriptures 
                to see where the certainty of salvation rests. The Bible teaches that your 
                security is not based on your ability to hold onto God, but on God's power to hold 
                onto you and the definitive nature of the gift He has given.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Nature of Eternal Life</h3>
            <p>The first point to consider is the word <strong>eternal</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When the Lord Jesus Christ gives life, it is defined by its unending nature. 
                    He stated, "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, 
                    neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." (John 10:28).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If this life could be lost, then it was never truly "eternal" to begin with; 
                    it would be conditional life. The Bible emphasizes that eternal life is a gift 
                    received by grace through faith in Christ, not something earned by works 
                    (Ephesians 2:8-9). A gift cannot be taken back if the giver is faithful and 
                    the gift is inherently permanent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Apostle John wrote, "And this is the record, that God hath given to us 
                    eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and 
                    he that hath not the Son of God hath not life." (1 John 5:11-12). The possession 
                    of the Son means the possession of the life He gives.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h3>Security by Divine Action</h3>
            <p>Your security is established and maintained by the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, 
                making it a triune guarantee.</p>
            <H4>1. Secured by the Son's Hand</H4>
            <p>Jesus Christ guarantees that the Father's will is for Him to lose "nothing" of those 
                given to Him (John 6:39). The believer is held in two hands simultaneously:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall 
                    any man pluck them out of my hand." (John 10:28)
                </li>
                <li>
                    "My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck 
                    them out of my Father's hand." (John 10:29)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Sealed by the Holy Spirit</h4>
            <p>When a person trusts in Christ, the Holy Spirit immediately indwells and marks that 
                person as belonging to God. This action is a seal that lasts until the final redemption.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel 
                    of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with 
                    that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance, until 
                    the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory." 
                    (Ephesians 1:13-14)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Holy Spirit acts as the "earnest" (a down payment or guarantee) of the 
                    full inheritance, guaranteeing the completion of God's purchase. Furthermore, 
                    the sealing is specified to last "unto the day of redemption" (Ephesians 4:30), 
                    indicating a permanent mark.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Guarded by the Father's Power</h4>
            <p>The believer is not left to their own failing strength but is actively preserved by 
                God Himself.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be 
                    revealed in the last time." (1 Peter 1:5)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The conviction of the Apostle Paul was based on God’s fidelity: "For I am 
                    persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor 
                    powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any 
                    other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in 
                    Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 8:38-39). The list of potential obstacles is 
                    comprehensive, concluding that nothing in "all creation" can nullify God’s love 
                    and saving work.

            <h2>Self-examination</h2>
            <p>Since eternal security rests on Christ's work, how can you know if you are genuinely 
                in Christ? Assurance is often distinguished from feelings by looking for the fruit 
                that the Holy Spirit produces in a believer's life.</p>
            <h3>Distinguishing Assurance from Feelings</h3>
            <p>Assurance is a settled conviction based on God's promises; feelings are transient and 
                unreliable.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assurance is by Word, not Emotion:</strong> True assurance is rooted in the 
                    "record" God has given (1 John 5:11). If you have believed on the name of the Son of 
                    God, the Scripture is written so that "ye may know that ye have eternal life" (1 John 5:13). 
                    The basis for knowing is the promise of God, not how spiritual you feel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Unreliability of Feelings:</strong> Salvation is by faith (Ephesians 2:8), 
                    which is the opposite of sight or feeling. Focusing on good days or bad days leads to 
                    doubt, as all have sinned and fall short (Romans 3:23).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Fruit of Repentance and Faith</h3>
            <p>The presence of the Spirit guarantees salvation, and the presence of fruit provides evidence 
                of the Spirit's dwelling. This evidence is a change in the direction of your life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Mark of New Birth:</strong> The one who is truly born of God will not 
                    live in habitual, unrepentant sin, because "his seed remaineth in him" (1 John 3:9). 
                    While a believer may fall into sin, the divine nature within causes the person to 
                    repent and return to walking in the light (1 John 1:9).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Walking in the Spirit:</strong> The presence of "the fruit of the Spirit" 
                    is evidence of the new life: "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, 
                    longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such 
                    there is no law." (Galatians 5:22-23).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Obedience as Evidence:</strong> The love of God and the keeping of His 
                    commandments become the natural desire of the born-again person. "And hereby we do 
                    know that we know him, if we keep his commandments." (1 John 2:3). This obedience 
                    is not a condition for receiving eternal life, but the proof that eternal life has 
                    been received.

            <h2>Common Pitfalls for Assurance</h2>
            <p>Doubt concerning eternal security often stems from a misunderstanding of the foundation 
                of salvation, leading believers to look in the wrong places for assurance.</p>
            <h3>1. Confusing Sanctification with Justification</h3>
            <p>This is the most frequent source of doubt.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Justification is the instantaneous, one-time act of God declaring a believer 
                    righteous based on Christ's finished work (Romans 5:1). It is the state of being saved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sanctification is the lifelong, ongoing process of being made more like Christ 
                    (Philippians 1:6). It is the evidence of being saved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Pitfall:</strong> Seeking assurance in the daily process of sanctification 
                    (your fluctuating holiness and obedience) rather than the fixed status of justification 
                    (Christ's perfect righteousness imputed to you) will always lead to doubt. Your security 
                    is in the finished work of Christ, not your unfinished work.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Misinterpreting Chastening for Condemnation</h3>
            <p>When a true believer sins, God responds with parental discipline, not eternal rejection.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chastening:</strong> "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every 
                    son whom he receiveth." (Hebrews 12:6). God disciplines His children as a sign of their 
                    sonship, to call them back to righteousness (Hebrews 12:11).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Condemnation:</strong> The Scripture clearly states that for those in Christ, 
                    "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not 
                    after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (Romans 8:1).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Pitfall:</strong> Believing that a period of divine discipline or a 
                    significant personal failure means you have been eternally disowned. The presence of 
                    chastening is, paradoxically, a sign that you are a son (Hebrews 12:8).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Relying on Emotional Highs or Spiritual Experiences</h3>
            <p>Assurance is a matter of fact based on God's Word, not a feeling based on subjective experience.</p>
            <p>The "record" is that God has given life in His Son (1 John 5:11). <strong>The Pitfall:
            </strong> Equating a lack of emotional fervour, powerful prayer experiences, or deep spiritual 
                "feelings" with a loss of God's favour or salvation. Feelings are fickle; God's word is 
                faithful: "If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself." (2 Timothy 2:13).</p>
            <p>To maintain assurance, one must continually direct attention away from self-performance 
                and back to the authority and power of Christ's promise.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>If You Have Fallen Away</h2>
            <p>It is possible for a true believer to stumble grievously or to backslide—to temporarily 
                turn from following Christ and walk in disobedience. The Scriptures address this 
                experience directly, emphasizing God's faithfulness even when the believer is unfaithful.</p>
            <h3>1. The Reality of the Backslider</h3>
            <p>The Bible acknowledges that believers can stray from the path. This spiritual distance is 
                a severe threat to their temporal walk and rewards but does not undo their eternal standing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Path of Sin Brings Death (Temporal):</strong> "Then when lust hath 
                    conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth 
                    death." (James 1:15). This death refers to the loss of fellowship, usefulness, 
                    and, in severe cases, the end of the believer's physical life (as seen in 1 
                    Corinthians 11:30 concerning the misuse of the Lord's supper). However, this 
                    physical or relational "death" does not equate to eternal damnation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Need for Repentance:</strong> The backslider is commanded to repent 
                    and return. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, 
                    and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9). This confession is not 
                    for a new salvation, but for the restoration of fellowship that was broken by sin.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. The Faithfulness of God in Your Absence</h3>
            <p>The eternal security of the backslidden believer is anchored in the reality of God’s 
                character, which remains constant even when the believer's commitment wavers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>God Abides Faithful:</strong> "If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: 
                    he cannot deny himself." (2 Timothy 2:13). God's faithfulness is not contingent 
                    upon the believer's continuous faith; it is fixed on His own nature and His 
                    covenant promise through Christ. His work (the justification and sealing) is complete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Discipline of Sonship:</strong> When a true believer falls away, they do 
                    not merely walk away unnoticed. They experience the chastening of the Father (Hebrews 
                    12:6-8), a painful process intended to restore them, proving that the relationship 
                    of Father and son remains intact. If the believer were not truly saved, there would 
                    be no reason for God to chastise them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Intercession of Christ:</strong>Your security is also held by the ongoing 
                    ministry of Jesus Christ in heaven, who "ever liveth to make intercession" for those 
                    who come unto God by him (Hebrews 7:25).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you are experiencing a state of being "fallen away," the teaching of eternal security 
                is not a license for sin, but a divine assurance that when you return to the Lord through 
                repentance, your position as a child of God is secure. Your return is already made possible 
                by the Spirit whom God sealed you with unto the day of redemption.</p>
