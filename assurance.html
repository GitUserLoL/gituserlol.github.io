            <h3>Are you 100% sure that you have eternal life?</h3>
            <p>If you are struggling with this question, it is essential to look at the Scriptures 
                to see where the certainty of salvation rests. The Bible teaches that your 
                security is not based on your ability to hold onto God, but on God's power to hold 
                onto you and the definitive nature of the gift He has given.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Nature of Eternal Life</h3>
            <p>The first point to consider is the word <strong>eternal</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When the Lord Jesus Christ gives life, it is defined by its unending nature. 
                    He stated, "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, 
                    neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." (John 10:28).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If this life could be lost, then it was never truly "eternal" to begin with; 
                    it would be conditional life. The Bible emphasizes that eternal life is a gift 
                    received by grace through faith in Christ, not something earned by works 
                    (Ephesians 2:8-9). A gift cannot be taken back if the giver is faithful and 
                    the gift is inherently permanent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Apostle John wrote, "And this is the record, that God hath given to us 
                    eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and 
                    he that hath not the Son of God hath not life." (1 John 5:11-12). The possession 
                    of the Son means the possession of the life He gives.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Security by Divine Action</h3>
            <p>Your security is established and maintained by the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, 
                making it a triune guarantee.</p>
            <H4>1. Secured by the Son's Hand</H4>
            <p>Jesus Christ guarantees that the Father's will is for Him to lose "nothing" of those 
                given to Him (John 6:39). The believer is held in two hands simultaneously:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall 
                    any man pluck them out of my hand." (John 10:28)
                </li>
                <li>
                    "My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck 
                    them out of my Father's hand." (John 10:29)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Sealed by the Holy Spirit</h4>
            <p>When a person trusts in Christ, the Holy Spirit immediately indwells and marks that 
                person as belonging to God. This action is a seal that lasts until the final redemption.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel 
                    of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with 
                    that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance, until 
                    the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory." 
                    (Ephesians 1:13-14)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Holy Spirit acts as the "earnest" (a down payment or guarantee) of the 
                    full inheritance, guaranteeing the completion of God's purchase. Furthermore, 
                    the sealing is specified to last "unto the day of redemption" (Ephesians 4:30), 
                    indicating a permanent mark.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Guarded by the Father's Power</h4>
            <p>The believer is not left to their own failing strength but is actively preserved by 
                God Himself.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be 
                    revealed in the last time." (1 Peter 1:5)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The conviction of the Apostle Paul was based on God’s fidelity: "For I am 
                    persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor 
                    powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any 
                    other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in 
                    Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 8:38-39). The list of potential obstacles is 
                    comprehensive, concluding that nothing in "all creation" can nullify God’s love 
                    and saving work.
