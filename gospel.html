            <h2>Life, Death, and What Comes After</h2>
            <p><strong>Have you ever wondered what happens after you die — or what it truly means to be right with
                    God?</strong>
                The Bible tells us that every person will stand before their Creator one day. The question is
                not <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>.
                And the standard will not be our opinions or good intentions, but God’s perfect law.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="panel">
            <h3>1) We have all broken God’s law.</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” — Romans 3:23<br />
                “Sin is the transgression of the law.” — 1 John 3:4
            </blockquote>
            <p>We have lied, stolen, lusted, hated, and loved ourselves more than God. These are not small things
                in His sight.
                They reveal a heart that has rebelled against the One who gave us life.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="panel">
            <h3>2) Judgment is certain.</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.” — Hebrews 9:27<br />
                “For the wages of sin is death.” — Romans 6:23a
            </blockquote>
            <p>Every sin must be punished because God is perfectly just. Justice demands payment — our good deeds
                cannot erase guilt.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="panel">
            <h3>3) The punishment for sin is the second death.</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “The fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable… shall have their part in the lake which
                burneth with fire and brimstone:
                which is the second death.” — Revelation 21:8
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hell is not an overreaction; it is the rightful consequence of rejecting God’s holiness. But mercy
                and truth meet at the cross.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="panel">
            <h3>4) Jesus Christ paid the price in full.</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”
                — Romans 5:8<br />
                “His soul was not left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.” — Acts 2:31
            </blockquote>
            <p>Jesus, the Son of God, stepped into our place. On the cross He bore the wrath we deserved — for
                both physical death and the
                spiritual death of separation from God. He rose again, proving His victory over sin and death.

            <h3>5) Eternal life is a free gift.</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” — Romans 6:23b
            </blockquote>
            <p>Salvation cannot be earned. It is a gift — freely offered to all who repent and believe. The moment
                you put your faith in
                Christ’s finished work, God forgives your sins, gives you new life, and adopts you as His own.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="panel">
            <h3>6) Good works cannot save you.</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God —
                not of works, lest any man should boast.”
                — Ephesians 2:8–9
            </blockquote>
            <p>Religion, morality, and good intentions can’t erase sin. Only the blood of Jesus can cleanse you
                completely.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="panel">
            <h3>7) You must respond personally.</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” — Romans 10:13
            </blockquote>
            <p>You are not saved by knowing <em>about</em> Jesus, but by trusting <em>in</em> Him — surrendering
                your life, believing His promise,
                and receiving Him as Lord and Saviour. This is not a ritual or formula; it is a relationship
                built on grace.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="panel">
            <h2>The Decision</h2>
            <p><strong>Every person must make a choice.</strong> Will you continue living for yourself, facing
                judgment for your own sins —
                or will you turn to Jesus Christ, who took your punishment so that you could live forever?</p>
            <blockquote>
                “Today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.” — Hebrews 3:15
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you’re ready to turn from sin and trust in Christ, speak to Him now — honestly, in your own
                words. Confess your need,
                thank Him for His sacrifice, and ask Him to save you. He promises that He will.</p>

            <h2>Making Sense of It All</h2>
            <p>The gospel isn’t just a set of ideas — it’s a message that answers real questions about justice,
                forgiveness, and grace.
                Here are a few simple ways to understand what God has done for us:</p>
            <h3>1) The Judge and the Thief</h3>
            <p>Imagine someone steals something valuable and stands before a judge. He admits his guilt and
                promises, “I’ll never do it again.”
                A good judge cannot simply let him go because he said sorry. Justice must still be done — the
                law requires it.</p>
            <p>In the same way, God is perfectly just. He cannot overlook sin simply because we regret it. Sin
                demands a penalty, and that penalty is death.
                But Jesus stepped in and took that sentence upon Himself — not because we deserved it, but
                because He loved us.</p>
            <blockquote>
                “He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities.” — Isaiah 53:5
            </blockquote>
            <h3>2) The Forgiven Debt</h3>
            <p>Imagine you borrowed <strong>R1 million</strong> and couldn’t pay it back. You plead for
                forgiveness, and the lender decides to cancel the debt.
                You’re free — but the lender doesn’t magically get the money back. The loss doesn’t vanish;
                <em>he absorbs it himself.</em>
            </p>
            <p>That’s what God did for us. When He forgives sin, He doesn’t simply erase the record — He takes the
                cost upon Himself.
                Jesus bore that debt on the cross, paying with His blood what we could never repay.</p>
            <blockquote>
                “He paid a debt He did not owe; we owed a debt we could not pay.”
            </blockquote>
            <h3>3) The True Gift</h3>
            <p>If a friend offers you <strong>R100</strong>, but says you must first wash his car, it’s not really
                a gift — it’s a payment for work.
                Salvation is not like that. God’s gift of eternal life is truly free. You can’t earn it by good
                works, but you must receive it.
                A gift left unopened does you no good.</p>
            <p>God does not force salvation on anyone. The offer is there, but it must be accepted — by faith in
                Jesus Christ alone.</p>
            <blockquote>
                “The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” — Romans 6:23
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Justice was satisfied. Mercy was extended. The choice is yours.</strong></p>

            <h2>A Closing Thought</h2>
            <p>This is the gospel — the good news that the Son of God died and rose again to bring sinners back to
                the Father.
                It’s not just a message to hear; it’s a call to respond. The cross stands as the greatest act of
                love the world has ever seen.</p>
