			<h1>Apologetics</h1>

			<h2>Faith with Understanding</h2>
			<p>Believing blindly is not what Jesus called us to do—He told us to have faith like children, not ignorance
				like
				fools.
				Childlike faith is pure and trusting, but mature faith is also rooted in truth and understanding. In a
				world
				where every
				belief is questioned and every truth is challenged, we cannot afford to say, "I just believe." We must
				know why
				we believe.</p>
			<p>Many people reject Christianity not because they've truly understood it, but because of misunderstandings
				and
				half-truths.</p>
			<p>Common objections include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If God is so good, why is there so much suffering?</li>
				<li>The Bible was written by men, how can it be trusted?</li>
				<li>All religions lead to the same God, don't they?</li>
				<li>Science disproves the God of the Bible</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Understanding these challenges—and the truth behind them—is part of loving God with all your mind
				(Matthew
				22:37). Faith isn't fragile; it's built to be tested.</p>
			<blockquote>
				"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
				with
				<em>all thy mind</em>." -Matthew 22:37
			</blockquote>
			<p>We as followers of Christ should always be able to give an answer to why we believe and should always be
				able
				to give the gospel to someone
				at a moments noticed</p>
			<blockquote>
				"'preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering
				and
				doctrine." -2 Timothy 4:2
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Defending common objections</h2>
			<details>
				<summary>If God is Good, why is there so much suffering</summary>
				<p>Many of athiests have asked this question as a "gotcha question". I will not lie, this is one of the
					hardest
					questions to answer on a personal level. Theologically we can give very good answers to why
					this is but an athiest who does not believe the bible to begin with will not appreciate these
					answers. This
					questions adresses two different aspects of creation we need to look at:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Why does God permit moral evils toward one another?</li>
					<li>Why does God permit natural evils to happen to innocent people?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The following video by famous professor of mathematics John Lennox puts this question in light of
					morallity:
				</p>
				<div class="video-wrapper">
					<iframe
						allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
						allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"
						src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mEKPnY0P2a4?si=WfwQyo8bLLcnY9BO"
						title="John Lennox on God and Suffering"></iframe>
				</div>
				<p>At the end of the day as we can see in the video, the better questions to address is where does 
					morality come from? Atheism cannot answer this question since if the universe happend to be there is nothing like
					good and evil. There is no hope for the people asking this question if they do not believe there is a God. </p>
