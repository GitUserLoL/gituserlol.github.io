			<h2>Faith with Understanding</h2>
				<p>Believing blindly is not what Jesus called us to do. He told us to have faith like 
					children, not ignorance	like fools.	Childlike faith is pure and trusting, but 
					mature faith is also rooted in truth and understanding. In a world where every 
					belief is questioned and every truth is challenged, every person cannot afford 
					to say, "I just believe". Every person must take accountability of what they believe.</p>
				
				<p>Many people reject Christianity not because they've truly understood it, but because 
					of misunderstandings and half-truths.</p>
				<p>Common objections include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If God is so good, why is there so much suffering?</li>
					<li>The Bible was written by men, how can it be trusted?</li>
					<li>All religions lead to the same God, don't they?</li>
					<li>Science disproves the God of the Bible</li>
					<li>What about Atheism, Islam, Judiasm, and sects of Christianity?</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>What Does it Matter?</h2>
				<p>The most direct command for evangelism is given by Christ Himself after His resurrection, 
					known as the Great Commission. The Apostle Paul and others affirm that the preaching of 
					the Gospel is not an optional service but a divinely imposed duty.</p>
				<blockquote>
					"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you
					in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." 2 Corinthians 5:20
				</blockquote>
				<p>Understanding these challenges, and the truth behind them, is part of loving God with
					all your mind (Matthew 22:37). Faith isn't fragile; it's built to be tested.</p>
				<blockquote>
					"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
					with all thy soul, and with	<strong>all thy mind</strong>." -Matthew 22:37
				</blockquote>
				<p>We as followers of Christ should always be able to give an answer to why we believe 
					and should always be able to give the gospel to someone at a moments noticed</p>
				<blockquote>
					"'preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort 
					with all longsuffering and doctrine." -2 Timothy 4:2
				</blockquote>

			<details>
				<summary>What is Atheism?</summary>
					<p>Atheism is defined as an absence of belief in the existence of deities. Less broadly, 
						atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist.</p>
					<p>There is no official person or group that speaks on behalf of all atheists as it 
						pertains to their belief system. There are certain points, however, that are generally 
						common to all atheists. These are the “doctrines” that will be discussed and rebutted 
						out of respect for this worldview.</p>
				<summary>Evolution through Natural Selection</summary>
					<p>In his famous book The God Delusion, noted evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins explains 
						why he believes the theory of evolution by natural selection has explained away any need 
						for belief in God. In a chapter called “Why There Almost Certainly Is No God,” Dawkins 
						summarizes his reasoning into six points:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself. 
							In the case of a man-made artefact such as a watch, the designer really was an 
							intelligent engineer. It is tempting to apply the same logic to an eye or a wing, 
							a spider or a person.
						</li>
						<li>
							The temptation is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the 
							larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was 
							the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to 
							postulate something even more improbable. We need a “crane,” not a “skyhook,” for only 
							a crane can do the business of working up gradually and plausibly from simplicity to 
							otherwise improbable complexity.
						</li>
						<li>
							The most ingenious and powerful crane so far discovered is Darwinian evolution by natural 
							selection. Darwin and his successors have shown how living creatures, with their spectacular 
							statistical improbability and appearance of design, have evolved by slow, gradual degrees 
							from simple beginnings. We can now safely say that the illusion of design in living 
							creatures is just that — an illusion.
						</li>
						<li>
							We don’t yet have an equivalent crane for physics. Some kind of multiverse theory could in 
							principle do for physics the same explanatory work as Darwinism does for biology. The kind 
							of explanation is superficially less satisfying than the biological version of Darwinism, 
							because it makes heavier demands on luck. But the anthropic principle entitles us to postulate 
							far more luck than our limited human intuition is comfortable with.
						</li>
						<li>
							We should not give up hope of a better crane arising in physics, something as powerful as 
							Darwinism is for biology. But even in the absence of a strongly satisfying crane to match the 
							biological one, the relatively weak cranes we have at present are, when abetted by the 
							anthropic principle, self-evidently better than the self-defeating skyhook hypothesis of an 
							intelligent designer.
						</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Defending common objections</h2>
			<details>
				<summary>If God is Good, why is there so much suffering</summary>
				<p>Many of athiests have asked this question as a "gotcha question". I will not lie, this is one of the
					hardest
					questions to answer on a personal level. Theologically we can give very good answers to why
					this is but an athiest who does not believe the bible to begin with will not appreciate these
					answers. This
					questions adresses two different aspects of creation we need to look at:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Why does God permit moral evils toward one another?</li>
					<li>Why does God permit natural evils to happen to innocent people?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The following video by famous professor of mathematics John Lennox puts this question in light of
					morallity:
				</p>
				<div class="video-wrapper">
					<iframe
						allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
						allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"
						src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mEKPnY0P2a4?si=WfwQyo8bLLcnY9BO"
						title="John Lennox on God and Suffering"></iframe>
				</div>
				<p>At the end of the day as we can see in the video, the better questions to address is where does 
					morality come from? Atheism cannot answer this question since if the universe happend to be there is nothing like
					good and evil. There is no hope for the people asking this question if they do not believe there is a God. </p>
